# The Document Object Model (DOM)

## Contents
Herein are:
  * examples of writing to, reading from and manipulating the DOM.
  * Unit tests for practicing use the DOM API.


## Download

You can get a copy of this code repository in several ways:

1. use `git` to clone it:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/portsoc/dom101.git
   ```
   or
2. use the GitHub CLI tool:
   ```shell
   gh repo clone portsoc/dom101
   ```
3. download a [zip](https://github.com/portsoc/dom101/archive/master.zip) of this repository
   * This has the _disadvantage_ that if we publish improvements or bug fixes it will be harder for you to get hold of them (conversely using `git` you just have to type `git pull` at the command line to receive the updates).

If you're not familiar with the `git` & `gh` tools, or you have not yet installed them on your machine, we strongly suggest that you do install them and start the very worthwhile discovery process.


## Running

From your new local copy of the code:
* open `index.html` in your browser to see the listing of tests and their pass/fail status,
* edit `index.js` to add code until all the tests pass,
* try to improve the code to be cleaner, while checking that the tests continue to pass,
* and you may also examine (but do not change) `test.js` to understand exactly what is being tested.
